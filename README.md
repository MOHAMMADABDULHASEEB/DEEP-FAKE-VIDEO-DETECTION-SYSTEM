# DEEP-FAKE-VIDEO-DETECTION-SYSTEM
Deepfake technology has advanced rapidly, making it harder than ever to distinguish real from fake videos. These manipulated videos are being misused in misinformation campaigns, fraud, and identity theft.

This project presents a real-time deepfake detection system powered by deep learning (CNNs & RNNs). By analyzing both spatial and temporal inconsistencies, our system can accurately classify videos as real or fake â€” making it applicable for live streaming, social media monitoring, and video conferencing security.
